          The Code Green Campaign® is a first responder oriented mental health
          advocacy and education organization. Also known as Code Green, we
          serve all types of first responders. This includes firefighters, EMTs,
          paramedics, dispatchers, police, corrections, air medical, and search
          & rescue. Our name is a combination of the color for mental health
          awareness (green) and the “code alerts” used in emergency services. If
          someone is having a stroke or heart attack first responders will call
          a “code stroke” or “code STEMI”. The idea is that Code Green is
          calling a code alert on the mental health of first responders.
